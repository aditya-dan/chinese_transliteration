the lord is my shepherd; i shall not want.

he maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.

he restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever.
